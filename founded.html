            <p>Big Dave founded his chop shop in the summer of 1926.
            He put his blood, sweat, and tears into making his
            chop shop the best it could be. In 1950, Big Dave passed
            away in a tragic motorcycle accident. His younger brother
            stepped up to continue his legacy.</p></div>

            <p>Big Jim (Dave’s Little Brother) took the ropes and
            began to run his brothers chop shop in 1950, he kept
            the business thriving by always putting his best effort
            into keeping the business at a growing rate. In 1999
            Jim retired from the chop shop and passed it over to Big
            Dave’s son, Phil.</p>

            <p>Big Phil is the chop shops current owner, he has grown the
            business more than anyone has. He hired the best mechanic’s
            in the state to ensure only the best of work was being done.
            He also hired the best cooks in the state as well so that
            he could keep the food tasting great!</p>
