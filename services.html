        <h1>Engine Rebuilds</h1>
        <br />
        <p>Engine Rebuilds are a very long process that requires us to take apart
            your bike from the ground up so they are not cheap,
            these will cost you about $800-$2000 depending
            on the quality of parts you want installed.
        </p>

            <h1>Suspension Upgrades</h1>
            <br />
            <p>Suspension upgrades are pretty quick but very costly,
                fork and shock kits are normally around $1200 for a quality set and will cost you $200 in labor,
                all this adds up to a grand total of $1400.

            <h1>Tuning</h1>
            <br />
            <p>Tuning takes a bit more time because of the research and testing needed to complete it.
                Your bike needs to be put on a dyno and tested so that it can be accurately tuned.
                This normally adds up to $300 with labor included.
            </p>

            <h1>Exhaust Installs</h1>
            <br />
            <p>A good exhaust system is key to maximize air flow and engine performance,
                exhaust systems can run from $700-$1500 depending on the brand.
                Install will cost you $80.
