                It was a regular Thursday for most folks, but on June 22,
                Ed Aiton logged his 3,600 barbecue meal at Big Dave's Chop Shop 
                located in Winslow, Arizona. That day was really crazy and paked
                everyone wanted to watch him take on his 3.600 plate of barbeque.
                Boi was that a treat.

                It seems like 2017 was the year to provoke Texans via barbecue,
                and boy did it work. Eater sent a tweet that won't soon be forgotten
                in March, declaring Arizona as being well on its 
                way to barbecue capital status.

                One time I slipped on some sauce that I had dropped and the employees rushed
                out to help me and also gave me a free plate, even though it was all my fault.

                The other day when I walked into Big Dave's Chop Shop their was a celebrity.
                It was Zac Efron, he looked really mad at first but then after he had some food 
                he looked all happy and honestly that's what some good barbeque will do too you.

                The craziest celebrity sighting we had was when Henry Kissinger came 
                into the restaurant, and everyone wanted to take a picture with him.
                Even millennials wanted their picture with him. I didn't even think 
                they would know who he was.

                I used to see guys come in with their girlfriends/mistresses one night, 
                and then come in with their wives, literally, just a few days later. 
                I never saw anyone get caught (or at least there was never a huge blowout 
                in the restaurant), but I would seat them at the same table and say something 
                like, 'Have you dined with us before? You look very familiar.'"
