        <p>I'm at a lost for word with Daves BBQ...because EVERYTHING
            was simply amazing! I thought a Saturday morning attempt at
            Dave’s BBQ would entail long lines in the scorching heat, but
            I really lucked out with my visit. First, the family owned business
            now has a ticketing system which one will receive when they arrive.
            I still arrived 1hr prior to opening but found that most people
            started rolling in around 10:30am. It's really up to you if you
            want to risk the long and dreaded wait. Most yelpers were accurate
            in that people do tend to buy in bulk so items will be sold out later in the day.

        <p>I arrived an hour before they opened and
            there was already a long line ahead of me.
            nce they opened the doors at 11AM, I only had
            to wait about 25-30 minutes before I could order.
            If you want to make sure you get a taste of their
            delicious, mouthwatering, knee-shaking meat, then
            I suggest you arrive 1.5 hours ahead of time. Their
            main selection of meat was almost out by the time I
            ordered. Their mashed potatoes were also rich, creamy,
            and tasty. You'll be asking for more on your first bite.

            <p>OMG the absolute best best best brisket ever.
                The fatty brisket was sooooo delicious. I'm home
                back in California and I cannot stop thinking about
                it and cannot wait to go back to have it again. If you
                haven't been here PLEASE do yourself a favor and get right
                down there but, Get there early so they do not run out of
                fatty brisket. Service is top notch. They are so friendly and awesome.

                He really took the time to make sure everything was locked in
                tight and the bike looks great! Definitely found my new bike
                mechanic, I trust Dave with my bike and the products he uses.
                The AMS Oil truly is the best product for your Harley. My bike
                runs great. My second time here and won't be my last. If you're
                looking for a hard working guy you found him! Protect your investment!
                I'll be returning once my other part comes in. He's knowledgeable
                and knows what to recommend to keep your bike running at its best.</p>

            <p>I was having an issue with my clutch slipping,
                the guys took me in right away and adjusted as much
                as they could. I rode it home and still felt it slipping,
                when they opened up the bike my spring plate had 'exploded'
                and their original diagnosis had been correct, so I upgraded
                my clutch pack so I won't ever have that particular problem
                again. I also needed a new front tire, I was looking at different
                tyles, trying to change up the stock look, Coach gave me some input
                and price matched the tire I had planned on ordering.
